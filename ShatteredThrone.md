# Shattered Throne

[Return to Tier List](https://nomentum66.github.io/)

### **Overall Difficulty:** D

Shattered Throne is by far the easiest dungeon in the game to solo. A victim of power creep, the only complex part of this dungeon in the modern age of Destiny is the mechanics for the Vorgeth fight. Other than that, this dungeon should be soloable by even novice dungeon-goers. The bosses fall easily in one phase, making recovering after a damage phase unnecessary, which may be the toughest part of each of the fights. Take the platforming slow and steady, and this dungeon should be easily beaten.

## Erebus
**Difficulty:** D

This encounter is very straightforward. In modern Destiny, there is little that should be able to kill you here other than falling off of the map. Bring a long range weapon like a scout rifle, sniper or machine gun to deal with sniper Taken, but otherwise loadouts are completely personal preference. Use a map to help you find your way around if you need, but otherwise this should be a simple opening fight.

Once you learn the spawns of enemies, you may decide to take specific paths to avoid being in the open for long periods of time (there is a bridge near the left-center of the map that has little cover and several snipers overlooking it once you walk on to it), but you should still be able to survive even without caring about your choice of path.

## The Descent
**Difficulty:** C-

For this section, I would recommend a scout rifle or a bow to deal with sniping enemies. The combat in this section is not hard, just tedious if you're playing to stay alive. The only reason this section is a C instead of a D is the length you have to traverse combined with narrow platforms and some Ogres that will attempt to knock you backwards in the room with the beams. There is a path along the left wall of that room that some players may be able to navigate along, which would skip most of the ogre section entirely. For the thrallway, since you cannot regenerate health on your own while in there, you can equip either Crimson, a solar subclass with healing, or a void subclass with access to Devour to safely pass through, although most people will not find this necessary and will simply just kill the thrall prior to being injured or killed (Warlocks have it easy and can just drop a healing rift if necessary). If you do need to regenerate health, you can drop down into the secret chest area, which (I believe) will allow you to heal before taking the portal back into the thrallway.

## Vorgeth, the Boundless Hunger
**Difficulty:** B-

This is the hardest encounter in Shattered Throne by a significant margin, but it is still quite manageable if you can move and kill quickly. For this encounter, I would recommend using a void primary weapon of choice, either Witherhoard or a stasis fusion rifle to kill the wizards quickly, and a linear fusion rifle of choice to kill Vorgeth. Subclass is not important, just as long as you are comfortable moving quickly and staying alive. I recommend staying near the left pillar once you drop down, then weaken the two wizards close to you (but don't kill them yet). Once they are both weak, kill the one by the front of the room, and rotate to the right (leave the other low one for now, that will be your last pickup). Rotate around the room, quickly killing the remaining wizards and picking up all 4 buffs. Once you dunk the buffs, this should be an easy one-phase. Make sure to kill the seekers firing at you so you do not die (Warlocks can tank these in a well, and titans could duck into a bubble if they're using that subclass). If you do not one-phase, quickly get back to the starting corner and repeat.

## The Ascent
**Difficulty:** D

This platforming section is quite a bit easier than the previous since there are fewer enemies sniping from long range. Use whatever loadout you would like, but I would recommend switching to your boss loadout pretty early on so you can get ammo for it. (I don't think they've added rally flags to this dungeon, but if they have then don't worry about ammo)

## Dul Incaru, the Eternal Return
**Difficulty:** C

The most annoying part of this encounter is the psions: if left unchecked, they can quickly overwhelm you. To avoid this, pick one side and go there immediately, and quickly wipe the psions on that side of the room, then go do the same on the other side. Once the psions are gone, survivability is quite simple. You only need around 15 seconds to kill Dul Incaru with the 3x buff, so you have some time to kill the knights. Use a linear fusion rifle (or even Whisper of the Worm) to make short work of the boss.

Tip for hunters and warlocks: Shadow Shot tether and Nova Bomb are both very good at dealing with the knights, and both can help take out some psions in the process. Consider using these if you feel confident with surviving.
