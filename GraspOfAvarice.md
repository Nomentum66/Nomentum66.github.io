# Grasp of Avarice

[Return to Tier List](https://nomentum66.github.io/)

## **Overall Difficulty:** C

This is the easiest "modern" dungeon in the game, with more intensive mechanics than either Pit of Heresy or Shattered Throne. However, this dungeon probably has one of the easiest combat challenges of all of the modern dungeons, which makes it fairly easy overall. The only two challenging portions of this dungeon to solo are the two bosses, and those can be handled pretty easily once you know the mechanics and learn the flow of the fight. I would recommend this dungeon as the first "challenging" dungeon to new solo-ers, as it sets a good baseline for dealing with the combat and mechanics of the modern dungeons..

## Opening Platforming
**Difficulty:** D+

You will need to deposit 50 engrams to enter the dungeon.

This is just a lot of learning the path and where traps are. Nothing too difficult, although some of the enemies might catch you a bit off-guard at times. Once you learn it it should be pretty easy.

## Phry'zhia the Insatiable
**Difficulty:** B

You will need to deposit 25 engrams to make the boss vulnerable.

Use your super liberally here, since every time you reach a multiple of 10 engrams you get your full ability energy back. I would recommend bubble titan, well-lock and blade barrage or gyrfalcon's hunter for this encounter. I would dump all of your engrams each time between sides to ensure they do not time out while waiting for the door to open, using a defensive super to help with that (i.e., pick up one door's worth of engrams, then go back to the crystal and drop a ward/well to deposit, then pick up the engrams from the other side and deposit, then use your super for damage phase and repeat). For loadouts, I would recommend Witherhoard or a Riptide with Chill Clip, an SMG or other close-range ad-clear weapon, and an LFR for boss damage. This boss is fairly straightforward to solo, but just make sure you're using your abilities (including super) liberally since you'll get them back so often. You can either DPS from behind the crystals or from off to the right side on the ledge (the latter is safer and has more coverage but you can lose some time getting there). This should be around a 3-phase.

## Sparrow
**Difficulty:** C+

With Always on Time, you only need to hit 1 button per mine to succeed (this might also be the case with other sparrows but the timings will be a lot tighter). Technically you can just drive through the mine at full speed and it will completely finish defusing, but the mines are a good place to remount on a new sparrow if your old one breaks. For the last mine going into the skull, there is a node in the left eye off the left cannon. Your sparrow might overjump that button so be aware and ready to dismount if necessary (there is another button before that so you won't necessarily need to press it, but you should be aware of your timer). This is an encounter you can learn to beat with practice, learn what buttons you need to press and you should be fine.

## Shield Shutdown
**Difficulty:** D

You will need to deposit 20 engrams per servitor to make them vulnerable.

Nothing really to say other than take it slow and steady. This encounter is fairly simple so just take your time.

## Captain Avarokk, the Covetous
**Difficulty:** B

You will need to deposit 60 engrams to make the boss vulnerable.

For this encounter, I used Witherhoard, an SMG and an LFR. Use the subclass of your choice, although bubble, well, and invisibility are really good here for surviving while dunking. Once the encounter starts and following each boss damage phase, your first priority should be clearing out a safe space for yourself on one of the sides, then killing the floating shank miniboss since it hurts a decent amount. Prior to dropping the engrams, clear out most of the ads so you can move efficiently and not worry about dying. This will allow you to carry the scorch cannon and more quickly chain together multiple engram drops. Once the engrams drop, if you move efficiently you can pick up 20 at a time (one side plus the island around the front of the room). Depending on your timer and the ad situation you can either dunk these 20/however many you get or use the scorch cannon to open up more. Once you have 50 you can go to the middle and dunk, and killing the vandal miniboss will drop 10 more, which will be enough for the damage phase to start. I would recommend setting up for damage at the back of the room behind the box, but make sure you deposited all of your engrams before doing that.
