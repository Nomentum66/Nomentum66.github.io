## Guide Information
This guide assumes you know the basic mechanics of the encounter and could complete the dungeon in a fireteam of 3. It will give advice on how to best approach encounters, as well as nuanced mechanics that may be beneficial to solo players and other tips for staying alive.

## What the ratings mean
Within each tier, the encounters are approximately the same difficulty. Tiers with a + have a slightly higher mechanical complexity or combat requirement than the base tier, and tiers with a - have a slightly simpler mechanical complexity or combat requirement than the base tier, but both still follow the majority of the criteria laid out below.

D: This dungeon/encounter can be soloed with little effort. For dungeons, this means there are few encounters that are challenging, and no special loadouts are needed to effectively complete it. For encounters, they are significantly easier than their counterparts and need minimal preparation to be able to complete comfortably.

C: This dungeon/encounter may have one or two parts that are more challenging and require practice and/or effective loadouts to complete, but the majority is very straightforward and simple. For dungeons, this means either that 1) there may be one or two more difficult encounters that could trip people up, but other than that the remaining portion of the dungeon could be classified in the D-tier; or 2) all encounters are fairly equally straightforward but are more difficult or require more complex mechanics than D-tier encounters. For encounters, these are instances that may require practice or planning on how to beat but are not altogether that difficult. They are not something to be completely overlooked, and not preparing for them could mess up a run.

B: This dungeon/encounter requires a fairly optimized loadout and decent skill to beat, although it is either not that complex mechanically or the combat challenge is very low. For dungeons, most of the encounters are fairly difficult either mechanically or in combat, but there are several portions of the raid that are easier than A or S rated dungeons. For encounters, these are fairly challenging encounters that may take a few runs to get familiar with, and require a fairly optimized loadout in order to beat.

A: This dungeon/encounter requires quite a bit of practice to be able to comfortably beat, and has a lot of mechanical complexity and combat challenge. For dungeons, this means that many of the encounters are challenging in combat, mechanics, or both, and requires a well-optimized loadout to beat.  For an encounter, this is a mechanically- or combat-intensive fight, usually both, that requires practice to beat, as learning the flow of an encounter will greatly help with survivability. Often these encounters have very little down time once the action starts and requires focus and consistency to beat.

S: This dungeon/encounter is extremely mechanically- AND combat-intensive and will require much skill, practice, and patience to beat. For dungeons, this means that all of the encounters will be challenging and require fully-optimized loadouts to beat, even for the best of players. For encounters, this means that complex mechanics and extremely challenging combat are both a significant part of it, and wipes are very swift and punishing. These encounters are also very long solo, requiring endurance to be able to maintain focus throughout a long fight.

# Shattered Throne
## **Overall Difficulty:** D

Shattered Throne is by far the easiest dungeon in the game to solo. A victim of power creep, the only complex part of this dungeon in the modern age of Destiny is the mechanics for the Vorgeth fight. Other than that, this dungeon should be soloable by even novice dungeon-goers. The bosses fall easily in one phase, making recovering after a damage phase unnecessary, which may be the toughest part of each of the fights. Take the platforming slow and steady, and this dungeon should be easily beaten.

## Erebus
**Difficulty:** D

This encounter is very straightforward. In modern Destiny, there is little that should be able to kill you here other than falling off of the map. Bring a long range weapon like a scout rifle, sniper or machine gun to deal with sniper Taken, but otherwise loadouts are completely personal preference. Use a map to help you find your way around if you need, but otherwise this should be a simple opening fight.

Once you learn the spawns of enemies, you may decide to take specific paths to avoid being in the open for long periods of time (there is a bridge near the left-center of the map that has little cover and several snipers overlooking it once you walk on to it), but you should still be able to survive even without caring about your choice of path.

## The Descent
**Difficulty:** C-

For this section, I would recommend a scout rifle or a bow to deal with sniping enemies. The combat in this section is not hard, just tedious if you're playing to stay alive. The only reason this section is a C instead of a D is the length you have to traverse combined with narrow platforms and some Ogres that will attempt to knock you backwards in the room with the beams. There is a path along the left wall of that room that some players may be able to navigate along, which would skip most of the ogre section entirely. For the thrallway, since you cannot regenerate health on your own while in there, you can equip either Crimson, a solar subclass with healing, or a void subclass with access to Devour to safely pass through, although most people will not find this necessary and will simply just kill the thrall prior to being injured or killed (Warlocks have it easy and can just drop a healing rift if necessary). If you do need to regenerate health, you can drop down into the secret chest area, which (I believe) will allow you to heal before taking the portal back into the thrallway.

## Vorgeth, the Boundless Hunger
**Difficulty:** B-

This is the hardest encounter in Shattered Throne by a significant margin, but it is still quite manageable if you can move and kill quickly. For this encounter, I would recommend using a void primary weapon of choice, either Witherhoard or a stasis fusion rifle to kill the wizards quickly, and a linear fusion rifle of choice to kill Vorgeth. Subclass is not important, just as long as you are comfortable moving quickly and staying alive. I recommend staying near the left pillar once you drop down, then weaken the two wizards close to you (but don't kill them yet). Once they are both weak, kill the one by the front of the room, and rotate to the right (leave the other low one for now, that will be your last pickup). Rotate around the room, quickly killing the remaining wizards and picking up all 4 buffs. Once you dunk the buffs, this should be an easy one-phase. Make sure to kill the seekers firing at you so you do not die (Warlocks can tank these in a well, and titans could duck into a bubble if they're using that subclass). If you do not one-phase, quickly get back to the starting corner and repeat.

## The Ascent
**Difficulty:** D

This platforming section is quite a bit easier than the previous since there are fewer enemies sniping from long range. Use whatever loadout you would like, but I would recommend switching to your boss loadout pretty early on so you can get ammo for it. (I don't think they've added rally flags to this dungeon, but if they have then don't worry about ammo)

## Dul Incaru, the Eternal Return
**Difficulty:** C

The most annoying part of this encounter is the psions: if left unchecked, they can quickly overwhelm you. To avoid this, pick one side and go there immediately, and quickly wipe the psions on that side of the room, then go do the same on the other side. Once the psions are gone, survivability is quite simple. You only need around 15 seconds to kill Dul Incaru with the 3x buff, so you have some time to kill the knights. Use a linear fusion rifle (or even Whisper of the Worm) to make short work of the boss.

Tip for hunters and warlocks: Shadow Shot tether and Nova Bomb are both very good at dealing with the knights, and both can help take out some psions in the process. Consider using these if you feel confident with surviving.

# Pit of Heresy
## **Overall Difficulty:** C

This dungeon is also a victim of power creep when it comes to the final boss, but the Chamber of Suffering encounter can still catch people out if they aren't careful. Using a map for the two platforming sections is highly recommended, as it is very easy to get lost in each of them. I would say the Chamber of Suffering encounter is one of the harder encounters in the game to solo, since it gets very hectic after depositing orbs, but outside of that this dungeon is pretty simple.

## Necropolis
**Difficulty:** D

Nothing particularly difficult for soloing here, just take your time. The elevators used to be bugged to sometimes kill you, I'm not sure if that's the case still but regardless I'd go from top to bottom and avoid them just to be safe. If you do need to take an elevator, stand closer to the middle, since I think it's the edges that would kill you.

## Tunnels of Despair
**Difficulty:** C-

It may be hard to get the ogres to move without a second person to draw aggro, so you may need to go out another door and get them to chase you there, then double back. If you end up in the open by an ogre, you should be able to tank a stomp but try and get back to cover as quickly as possible. You don't need a map but it might be useful to know how to navigate the area better. There is a ledge on the very far left side from where you drop down that you can use to go under/around the left ogre, use that to your advantage on that side.

## Chamber of Suffering
**Difficulty:** A-

For this encounter, loadout should probably consist of a machine gun for long-range ad-clear and something for short-range ad clear. Survivability is key here. I would recommend that warlocks be on either well or devour, titans on bubble, and hunters on invisibility. I usually use an SMG and either Witherhoard or Riptide with Chill Clip, both work great here (If I had to choose, I would probably recommend Riptide to kill the orb bearers faster and for CC). Every time you dunk a ball, two knights with arc shields will spawn up top that you will have to kill. However, if you dunk more than one ball in quick succession, only one set of knights will spawn. I highly recommend bringing one ball back and leaving it on the ground/on the annihilator totem while you get a second one. Make sure to occasionally pick the ball up so it doesn't respawn. You can dunk in sets of 2 once you collect another ball. (Theoretically, you could go for 3 balls at a time to only spawn one set of knights during the encounter but that is a bit riskier timing wise since you need to dunk to get rid of your debuff stacks. I advise going for only 2 at a time.) This encounter is just about rhythm and practice. As soon as you dunk the two balls, if you have a roaming super, pop it to help deal with the ads that will spawn. The next bit of time after dunking is just to recover and reorient yourself so you can get ready for collecting more balls. Repeat until 6 balls have been dunked.

## Harrow
**Difficulty:** C

Pull up a map. Seriously. Do it. This room can be confusing without one. The only reason this is hard is because of the jumps and swinging/moving spiky things, so be carful there.

## Zulmak, Instrument of Torment
**Difficulty:** B-

After using the sword to kill any of the 3 main enemies in their respective rooms, DO NOT pick up and dunk the ball! Once you kill all 3 enemies, the balls will respawn, so you can take your time to kill ads and then pick up and dunk the balls after killing all of the main enemies. I would recommend dunking each ball one node to the side of where it spawns, since the boss will likely be standing by the closest dunk point and can hurt (i.e., dunk each ball in the receptacle either counter-clockwise or clockwise to where it spawned). During boss phase, watch out for cursed thrall as they will come and try to kill you. I recommend Witherhoard and an SMG for ad-clear, and an LFR for boss damage. Prioritize your life over damage, this boss doesn't have a ton of health so it's an easy 2-phase, but a 1-phase is possible if you play well.

# Grasp of Avarice
## **Overall Difficulty:** C

This is the easiest "modern" dungeon in the game, with more intensive mechanics than either Pit of Heresy or Shattered Throne. However, this dungeon probably has one of the easiest combat challenges of all of the modern dungeons, which makes it fairly easy overall. The only two challenging portions of this dungeon to solo are the two bosses, and those can be handled pretty easily once you know the mechanics and learn the flow of the fight. I would recommend this dungeon as the first "challenging" dungeon to new solo-ers, as it sets a good baseline for dealing with the combat and mechanics of the modern dungeons..

## Opening Platforming
**Difficulty:** D+

You will need to deposit 50 engrams needed to enter the dungeon.

This is just a lot of learning the path and where traps are. Nothing too difficult, although some of the enemies might catch you a bit off-guard at times. Once you learn it it should be pretty easy.

## Phry'zhia the Insatiable
**Difficulty:** B

You will need 25 engrams to make the boss vulnerable.

Use your super liberally here, since every time you reach a multiple of 10 engrams you get your full ability energy back. I would recommend bubble titan, well-lock and blade barrage or gyrfalcon's hunter for this encounter. I would dump all of your engrams each time between sides to ensure they do not time out while waiting for the door to open, using a defensive super to help with that (i.e., pick up one door's worth of engrams, then go back to the crystal and drop a ward/well to deposit, then pick up the engrams from the other side and deposit, then use your super for damage phase and repeat). For loadouts, I would recommend Witherhoard or a Riptide with Chill Clip, an SMG or other close-range ad-clear weapon, and an LFR for boss damage. This boss is fairly straightforward to solo, but just make sure you're using your abilities (including super) liberally since you'll get them back so often. You can either DPS from behind the crystals or from off to the right side on the ledge (the latter is safer and has more coverage but you can lose some time getting there). This should be around a 3-phase.

## Sparrow
**Difficulty:** C+

With Always on Time, you only need to hit 1 button per mine to succeed (this might also be the case with other sparrows but the timings will be a lot tighter). Technically you can just drive through the mine at full speed and it will completely finish defusing, but the mines are a good place to remount on a new sparrow if your old one breaks. For the last mine going into the skull, there is a node in the left eye off the left cannon. Your sparrow might overjump that button so be aware and ready to dismount if necessary (there is another button before that so you won't necessarily need to press it, but you should be aware of your timer). This is an encounter you can learn to beat with practice, learn what buttons you need to press and you should be fine.

## Shield Shutdown
**Difficulty:** D

You will need 20 engrams per servitor to make them vulnerable.

Nothing really to say other than take it slow and steady. This encounter is fairly simple so just take your time.

## Captain Avarokk, the Covetous
**Difficulty:** B

You will need 60 engrams to make the boss vulnerable.

For this encounter, I used Witherhoard, an SMG and an LFR. Use the subclass of your choice, although bubble, well, and invisibility are really good here for surviving while dunking. Once the encounter starts and following each boss damage phase, your first priority should be clearing out a safe space for yourself on one of the sides, then killing the floating shank miniboss since it hurts a decent amount. Prior to dropping the engrams, clear out most of the ads so you can move efficiently and not worry about dying. This will allow you to carry the scorch cannon and more quickly chain together multiple engram drops. Once the engrams drop, if you move efficiently you can pick up 20 at a time (one side plus the island around the front of the room). Depending on your timer and the ad situation you can either dunk these 20/however many you get or use the scorch cannon to open up more. Once you have 50 you can go to the middle and dunk, and killing the vandal miniboss will drop 10 more, which will be enough for the damage phase to start. I would recommend setting up for damage at the back of the room behind the box, but make sure you deposited all of your engrams before doing that.
