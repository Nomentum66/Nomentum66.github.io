# Pit of Heresy

[Return to Tier List](https://nomentum66.github.io/)

## **Overall Difficulty:** C

This dungeon is also a victim of power creep when it comes to the final boss, but the Chamber of Suffering encounter can still catch people out if they aren't careful. Using a map for the two platforming sections is highly recommended, as it is very easy to get lost in each of them. I would say the Chamber of Suffering encounter is one of the harder encounters in the game to solo, since it gets very hectic after depositing orbs, but outside of that this dungeon is pretty simple.

## Necropolis
**Difficulty:** D

Nothing particularly difficult for soloing here, just take your time. The elevators used to be bugged to sometimes kill you, I'm not sure if that's the case still but regardless I'd go from top to bottom and avoid them just to be safe. If you do need to take an elevator, stand closer to the middle, since I think it's the edges that would kill you.

## Tunnels of Despair
**Difficulty:** C-

It may be hard to get the ogres to move without a second person to draw aggro, so you may need to go out another door and get them to chase you there, then double back. If you end up in the open by an ogre, you should be able to tank a stomp but try and get back to cover as quickly as possible. You don't need a map but it might be useful to know how to navigate the area better. There is a ledge on the very far left side from where you drop down that you can use to go under/around the left ogre, use that to your advantage on that side.

## Chamber of Suffering
**Difficulty:** A-

For this encounter, loadout should probably consist of a machine gun for long-range ad-clear and something for short-range ad clear. Survivability is key here. I would recommend that warlocks be on either well or devour, titans on bubble, and hunters on invisibility. I usually use an SMG and either Witherhoard or Riptide with Chill Clip, both work great here (If I had to choose, I would probably recommend Riptide to kill the orb bearers faster and for CC). Every time you dunk a ball, two knights with arc shields will spawn up top that you will have to kill. However, if you dunk more than one ball in quick succession, only one set of knights will spawn. I highly recommend bringing one ball back and leaving it on the ground/on the annihilator totem while you get a second one. Make sure to occasionally pick the ball up so it doesn't respawn. You can dunk in sets of 2 once you collect another ball. (Theoretically, you could go for 3 balls at a time to only spawn one set of knights during the encounter but that is a bit riskier timing wise since you need to dunk to get rid of your debuff stacks. I advise going for only 2 at a time.) This encounter is just about rhythm and practice. As soon as you dunk the two balls, if you have a roaming super, pop it to help deal with the ads that will spawn. The next bit of time after dunking is just to recover and reorient yourself so you can get ready for collecting more balls. Repeat until 6 balls have been dunked.

## Harrow
**Difficulty:** C

Pull up a map. Seriously. Do it. This room can be confusing without one. The only reason this is hard is because of the jumps and swinging/moving spiky things, so be carful there.

## Zulmak, Instrument of Torment
**Difficulty:** B-

After using the sword to kill any of the 3 main enemies in their respective rooms, DO NOT pick up and dunk the ball! Once you kill all 3 enemies, the balls will respawn, so you can take your time to kill ads and then pick up and dunk the balls after killing all of the main enemies. I would recommend dunking each ball one node to the side of where it spawns, since the boss will likely be standing by the closest dunk point and can hurt (i.e., dunk each ball in the receptacle either counter-clockwise or clockwise to where it spawned). During boss phase, watch out for cursed thrall as they will come and try to kill you. I recommend Witherhoard and an SMG for ad-clear, and an LFR for boss damage. Prioritize your life over damage, this boss doesn't have a ton of health so it's an easy 2-phase, but a 1-phase is possible if you play well.
